Effective Date: [Date]

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") outlines the privacy practices for Compose RandomWords ("App"), a mobile application developed by [Company Name] ("we," "us," or "our"). This Policy applies to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information obtained through the App.

Information Collection and Use

The App is designed to provide a safe and age-appropriate experience for all users. We do not include any age-sensitive content within the App. Furthermore, we do not collect any personal information from our users, including but not limited to names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, or any other identifying information.

Automatically Collected Information

The App may collect certain non-personal information automatically, such as device information, operating system type, and version, unique device identifiers, and usage statistics. This information is collected solely for the purpose of improving the App's performance, analyzing user preferences, and optimizing user experience. This data is collected anonymously and does not personally identify any individual user.

Use of Cookies

The App does not use cookies or any similar tracking technologies that store information on the user's device.

Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share, sell, trade, or otherwise transfer any personal information of our users to third parties. Since we do not collect any personal information, there is no data to be shared or disclosed.

Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the information collected through the App from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of transmission or storage over the internet is completely secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of children is of utmost importance to us. The App does not contain any age-sensitive content, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from individuals under the age of 13. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13 years old, we will promptly delete it from our records. If you believe that we may have collected personal information from a child under 13, please contact us using the information provided at the end of this Policy.

Changes to this Policy

We reserve the right to modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the effective date will be indicated at the top of the Policy. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically to stay informed about our privacy practices.
